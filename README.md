# videohosting
A skeleton of (YouTube, I guess) a video delivery platform where users can upload and watch videos.

# Tech Stack
- I haven't fully decided yet, however, on a high-level/tbd status:
    - Frontend:
        - Next.js / typescript for the app
    - Backend
        - Google Firebase : authentication, app distribution
        - Google Services for pub/sub, google cloud storage for storing videos

can't wait til I commit my private keys for this! haha!
